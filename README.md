#  Blockchain-Based Agricultural Traceability

A simple yet powerful **blockchain solution** to make agriculture more **transparent and trustworthy**.  
This project tracks every step of a product’s journey — from **farm to table** — using **smart contracts** and **decentralized data storage**.

---

##  What It Does
- Farmers can **register their produce** and record key details.  
- Every stage (harvest, packaging, transport) is **logged on-chain**.  
- Consumers can **scan a QR code** to see where their food came from.  
- All records are **tamper-proof** and **verifiable** through the blockchain.

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Polygon  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Storage:** MongoDB 

---

##  How It Works
1. **Farmer adds product info** ( farm details, etc.)  
2. **Distributors & retailers update** the product’s status as it moves.  
3. **Consumers scan a QR code** to view the full blockchain history.

---

##  Why It Matters
Food fraud and lack of transparency are big challenges.  
This system builds **trust** and gives **visibility** to every stakeholder — ensuring safer, more accountable food supply chains.
